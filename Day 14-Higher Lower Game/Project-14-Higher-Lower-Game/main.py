### MAIN GAME FUNCTIONALITY ####
# initialize the variable to keep track of game and the game_score
isGameOver = False
game_score = 0

# pick our 2 initial celebrities
choiceA = pick_celebrity()
choiceB = pick_celebrity()

# in case we picked the same ones, repick again.
if choiceA == choiceB:
    choiceB = pick_celebrity()

# print the game's logo
print(logo)

# run the loop until the user guesses incorrectly and the game is over.
while not isGameOver:
    # print out the selections
    print_battle(choiceA, choiceB)

    # get the user guess
    user_pick = input("Who has more followers? Type 'A' or 'B' ").lower()

    # if user made the correct guess we clear the console, increase the score and reselect
    if user_pick == decide_winner(choiceA, choiceB):
        clear()

# Helpful tips  when working on the problem
# 1. breakdown the problem into chunks

# have main game loop where we go until the user loses

# pick the random celebrity from the list of data and store it in choiceA

# pick another random celebrity from the list of data and store it in choiceB

# offer the user to make the selection of which celebrity has more instagram following

# decide on whether the user has entered the right choice by comparing their popularity rankings

# if the user is right, make choiceA the previous choiceB and pick a new random celebrity to be choice BaseException

# print it out again to the console, repeat

# 2.
# make the todo list for each of the problems
# pick an easy task to work on todo

# 3.
# turn the problem into comments

# 4.
# Write code, fix more code, rinse repeat

# 5.
# Move on to the next task
